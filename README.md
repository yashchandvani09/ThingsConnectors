A "Things Connector" is a software module that logically connects a Thing or an IoT endpoint with SureMDM Agent running on the host machine. 

The Things Connector can be developed by the vendor of the Thing device or by any developer who has the technical knowledge to communicate with the Thing device over the common transport mechanism such as USB, BT, WiFi etc.

This Project is a Dummy Smart Bulb Connector. It replicates a Smart bulb, also provides information like on/off, Brightness, Temperature status and a bulb fading action.

Prerequisites for building and running the application:

1. Android studio and JDK 8 or later installed.
2. Android Device/Emulator with at least Android 7.

Once the prerequisites are met, download and open the project in Android studio. Build it and run the application on the device.

Application runs as a service to ensure it can communicate with the SureMDM agent in the background.
